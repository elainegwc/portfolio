  <h1>ELAINE HUANG</h1>
  <p style="color:purple;">
<i>A high school teen living in the Southern Bay Area of California.</i></p>
  <p>Believer in naps. <b>Lover</b> of breakfast foods. Enthusiastic fan of excellent books and even better milk tea.<br><i><b>Not</b></i> as big a fan of styrofoam, lobster or airplane bathrooms.<br>Aspiring scientist.</p>
  <p>In order to provide accessibility to a wider range of users, I plan to offer information for varying methods of contact, utilize subtitles if I upload videos, and implement retracting braille display. I'd also like to experiment with using pictures as backgrounds and adding more to my template so it doesnâ€™t look as similar to others'. I struggled with understanding how to adjust specific aspects of the page, such as background width and reviewed the HTML tutorial frequently. I still am not familiar with the language and have a lot more adjustments to make to my page in order to personalize it.</p>
  <p>In both Python and Scratch, loops, variables, and conditionals are used. While Scratch is more animation-based, Python can be used to code anything. Python also needs to have information imported, such as the turtle library, and specific wording is necessary.<br>I liked trying new variations of what I had coded to see what the problem was and how I could fix it. It was satisfying to find what was the root of the trouble, although it was sometimes difficult since the mistakes were usually small and easily overlooked.</p>
